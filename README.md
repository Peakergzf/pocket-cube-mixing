# Pocket Cube Mixing

We use the concept of [Markov chain mixing time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_mixing_time) to determine the number of moves required to mix up a 2x2x2 Rubik's cube. Two approaches are used here:
* direct computation of the distance from stationarity d(t)
* hypothesis test of the distance between two distributions
